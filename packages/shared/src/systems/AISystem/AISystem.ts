/**
 * State machines are stateless... they act as decision making tree that accepts the current state and data to determine which components should be on/off
 *
 * aiBrain is reactive -> other systems and interactions can trigger events and the aiBrain will react accordingly
 *
 * EX
 * * "TARGET_ACQUIRED" event emission is sent to aiBrain
 * * if current state has a handler for the event type its state will be altered and the necessary components will be modified
 *
 *
 * (later) component modifications should be buffered to happen at the start of the next frame
 * * events will have priority, if a higher priority event is emitted before the previous event is processed, only the highest priority event should be emitted
 *
 *
 *
 * how do events get emitted and processed?
 * * map of "types" to state machines created
 * * each entity has a "type" that determines which state machine to pull
 * * event emitted with an EID, event type, and data
 * * * updateAISystem could read various parts of entity state and emit events? For example, it could check health every frame and if the percentage meets a threshold emit "FLEE" event
 * * * other systems will emit events, FSM reacts to these events and enables/disables behaviors by adding/removing components
